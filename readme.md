# Introduction

It's so amazing that I can introduce you my ***Music Application***.

This project has been created just for fun ü§°, and should not be treated as an formal or official project.
So why the hell I've decided to craete this kind of application, if I am not going to publish it or make some money of it?

Well, the answer is short and simple: **I don't want to, [Spotify](https://spotify.com) is more convinient and better way to go, than mine simple project**

# How to start

## Server Configuration

First of all, please make sure, that you have installed all of the required dependencies (dev, and normal).
